      <h3>💡 Why I Built GymMate</h3>
      <p>
        I am a gym owner myself. Earlier, members used to sign in using a physical register, which made it impossible
        for me to track
        attendance or check whose membership had expired.
        Now with <strong>GymMate</strong>, I can easily see who’s visiting the gym, whose membership has expired, and
        even send payment
        reminders.
        It has made managing my gym simple and transparent, even from miles away.

          <h3>🏋️ Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            To empower gym owners and trainers with digital tools that help them focus more on
            training people and less on paperwork. I believe that technology should support
            fitness, not complicate it.

          <h3>👨‍💻 About the Creator</h3>
          <p>
            GymMate is developed and maintained by <strong>Ramaraj T</strong>, an IT manager and
            fitness enthusiast who runs <strong>Muscle Madness Fitness Center</strong> in his village.
            The app was born out of a personal need to track gym attendance and fees
            efficiently without spending on cloud servers.

          <h3>🌍 Future Vision</h3>
          <p>
            The plan is to keep GymMate free and open for all. Future updates will include
            automatic WhatsApp notifications, member logins, and online payment options —
            all designed with simplicity and affordability in mind.
